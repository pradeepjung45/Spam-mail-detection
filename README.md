                              Spam Mail Detection
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using a Logistic Regression model. The system processes text data (email content), transforms it into numerical features, and then classifies the email as spam or ham (not spam). The project makes use of various machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.

                              Features
Email classification: Classify emails as spam or ham.
Machine Learning model: Uses Logistic Regression for classification.
Text feature extraction: Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to transform email content into numerical vectors.
Requirements
Install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-mail-detection.git
cd spam-mail-detection
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Ensure the dataset (mail_data.csv) is located in the project directory.
Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:

Category: Label for the email, either "spam" or "ham".
Message: The email message content.

                        How it Works
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.
Replace any missing values with empty strings.
Split the data into training and test sets (80% training, 20% test).
Feature Extraction:

Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert email text into numerical data that can be fed into the model.
Model Training:

Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the accuracy of the model on both the training and test datasets.
Prediction:

Predict whether a new email is spam or ham.
Usage
Training and Evaluation:

You can train the model and evaluate its accuracy by running the following:

bash
Copy code
python spam_detection.py
Example output:

csharp
Copy code
Accuracy on training data: 96.7%
Accuracy on test data: 96.5%
Making Predictions:

To test the model with your own input, modify the input_mail variable:

python
Copy code
input_mail = ["This is the 2nd time we have tried 2 contact u."]
Example output:

Copy code
Spam mail

                      Future Improvements
Implement other classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to compare results.
Create a web-based UI for users to upload email messages and get predictions.
